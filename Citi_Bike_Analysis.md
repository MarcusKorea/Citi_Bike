# Citi Bike Analysis

- It can be seen that the amount of rides is highest in September (96,671) rides. After September the rides decrease. 
- The lowest point in the year was February (4,801) rides.

**Does lower rides mean lower  *member* membership counts?**
- Looking at the *member* and *casual* membership types throughout the year we can see that *causal* memberships drop and *member* memeberships rise, suggesting that the casual members are swapping to memberships for a month. (Maybe there was a special deal that lasted a month)
- In October both membership types decrease. (Maybe people are saving their money for the holiday season,it is also getting colder, maybe people arent riding as much)


**Looking closer at the Winter months**
- The Winter months have the lowest ride (and membership )counts.
- February has the lowest count 4,801.
- The *member* membership type is more than half of the members for all 3 Winter months.
- Peak time in Winter is 4pm with 2,446 rides starting at that time (this may be the time people start to finish work), followed closly by 3pm and 5pm.
- Least buisest time is 3am (not surprising).
- Most common ride duration in Winter is approximatly 5 min (2,608 rides), followed very closley by 4min (2,605 rides) with very few people riding for more than an hour at a time.
- Majority of rides lasted less than 15 min, maybe people are using the bikes to get to work, or to get to places that are just slightly too far to walk to. Winter being cold may also be a factor.


**Looking at Summer Month**
- Peak time is 6pm (24,941)
- Summer months have a lot more rides overall in total
- Least busiest time is 4am (748 rides)
- It can be seen that the Summer peak and least busiest times slightly later than the Winter times, maybe this is because the days are longer in the Summer and the sun is out at different times.
- The most common ride duration is 6 minutes, one minutes longer than the most common Wtiner ride duration.
